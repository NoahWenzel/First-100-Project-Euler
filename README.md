# First-100-Project-Euler
Shows how I solved the first 100 Project Euler problems. Lots of comments left in and bad code commented out so I can retrace my through process looking back.

Remember to solve these problems on your own first to get the enjoyment and experiance of exploring and finding an answer! Only look at problems that you have previously solved yourself.
